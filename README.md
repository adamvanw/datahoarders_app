## Data Hoarders Desktop App

This app, created using Golang, its SQL driver, and Raylib, allows you to sift through a locally deployed (or remotely-deployed) version of our database.
It features individual pages for each coach, player, team, and game, as well as providing a list for each table to sift through.
You may also search using the search box and will give you all results close to your query, grabbing from all tables (except games_log).

You may run this app by installing Golang on your local machine, cloning this repo to your machine, and run the following commands:
```go get -v -u github.com/gen2brain/raylib-go/raylib```
```go get -u github.com/go-sql-driver/mysql```
```go run .```
